# Static random password to both slots on many YubiKeys

This is a simple powershell script to ease the configuration of many YubiKeys in the same manner with a static password. 

It generates a password of desired length from desired chars, and then writes it to both slots of the YubiKey. 

I needed it for work purposes.
